                <h2>Sylhet Division</h2>
                <p>Sylhet is a populous and large division of Bangladesh. The former name of the division is Jalalabad. It is located in the North-East side of the country. It has four districts; Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj and Sunamganj.
                In 1874, the current Sylhet Division, which included Karimganj District, was entirely known as the 'Sylhet district'. On
                16 February 1874, Sylhet was separated from mainland Bengal to be made a part of the non-regulation Chief Commissioner's
                Province of Assam (Northeast Frontier Province) in order to facilitate Assam's commercial development. The people of Sylhet submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy protesting the inclusion in Assam. The protests subsided when the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, visited Sylhet to reassure the people that education and justice would be administered from Bengal, and when the people in Sylhet saw the opportunity of employment in tea estates in Assam and a market for their produce. In 1905, Sylhet district rejoined Bengal as a part of the new Surma Valley Division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1912, the then Sylhet district was once again moved to the newly created Assam Province alongside the other districts of the Surma Valley Division.</p>
