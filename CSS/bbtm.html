            he Weeknd, born Abel Makkonen Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, is an artist of Ethiopian descent known
            for his distinctive voice and genre-blending music. He first gained recognition with his debut mixtape House of Balloons
            in 2011, which introduced his dark, atmospheric style and featured hits like “Wicked Games.” Collaborating with Drake on
            Take Care further boosted his early career. In 2013, he released his debut studio album, Kiss Land, which explored
            haunting themes. His second album, Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), brought mainstream success with hits like “Can't
            Feel My Face” and “The Hills,” winning him a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. He also earned an Academy Award
            nomination for “Earned It,” featured in the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. The Weeknd's third album, Starboy (2016),
            debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and included the chart-topping title track featuring Daft Punk. Known for his
            enigmatic persona, The Weeknd transitioned from his iconic dreadlocks during the Starboy era and continues to push
            boundaries, collaborating with artists like Kanye West, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande.<br>

            I made sure I held you close to me,<br>
            Drugs and smoking are substances that can have severe consequences on both physical and mental health. While they may
            offer temporary relief or pleasure, they often lead to addiction, impair judgment, and damage vital organs such as the
            lungs, heart, and brain. Smoking, for example, is a leading cause of preventable diseases like cancer and respiratory
            disorders, while drugs can disrupt lives, relationships, and communities. The harmful effects often outweigh any
            perceived benefits, making it crucial to raise awareness about their dangers and promote healthier lifestyle choices.<br>
