            BMW can trace its roots back to Karl Rapp and Gustav Otto. In 1916, the Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto company had
            merged into Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW) at government behest. Elsewhere, in 1917, the Rapp Motorenwerke company
            became Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, which was duly converted into an AG (public limited company) in 1918. BMW AG
            subsequently transferred its engine construction operations - including the company and brand names - to BFW in 1922.
            The date of BFW's founding, 7 March 1916, has therefore gone down in history as the foundation date of Bayerische
            Motoren Werke AG.
            The history of the BMW Group reaches back to 1916. Today, the four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce, and BMW Motorrad make
            the BMW Group one of the world's leading premium suppliers of automobiles, motorcycles, as well as mobility services.
            Since the beginning of its history, the company has kept its sight firmly set on the future and has consequently put
            sustainability and efficient resource management into the centre of its strategy. Learn more about the history and
            historical focus of the BMW Group.
            After the Second World War, allied soldiers requisitioned and occupied the BMW plants. Since BMW had been classified as
            an armaments company, machines and tools were dismantled. From 1945 onwards “stopgap” production, mainly of household
            appliances, was started in Milbertshofen - as was also the case at the Berlin plant.
