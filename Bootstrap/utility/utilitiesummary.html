        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>One night, a burglar quietly sneaked into a house, carefully tiptoeing through the dark living room. As he reached for a
        valuable-looking vase, a voice suddenly whispered, "Jesus is watching you." The burglar froze, his heart pounding. He
        shone his flashlight around but saw nothing. After a moment of silence, he brushed it off and continued searching for
        valuables. Then, he heard it again, "Jesus is watching you." Now completely spooked, he frantically scanned the room
        with his flashlight until the beam landed on a parrot perched in a cage. Letting out a relieved sigh, he chuckled and
        said, "Oh man, you scared me! What's your name, little guy?" The parrot tilted its head and replied, "Moses." The
        burglar laughed, shaking his head. "What kind of people name their parrot Moses?" The parrot calmly responded, "The same
        kind who name their Rottweiler Jesus." Before the burglar could react, a deep, menacing growl echoed from the shadows,
        and he turned just in time to see a massive Rottweiler lunging toward him. As he screamed in terror, he
        realizedâ€”sometimes, when a parrot warns you, you should really listen!</p>
