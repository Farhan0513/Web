                <h2>Abel Tesfaye</h2>
                <p>Abel was just a random guy from Torronto, Canada. He was dropped out of the college. He then forced his friends to do the same. He was literally living homeless. He hated his name. So, he wanted to name himself 'The Weekend'. But there was already another band in Canada named 'The Weekend'. So, he named himself 'The Weeknd'. In 2013, he started his music career. He made his first album 'Kissland'. Then he earned a lot of fame. His album 'Beauty Behind The Madness' became one of the top musical albums in 2015. Then in 2016, he released the album 'Starboy'. The album changed his whole career. The song 'Starboy', 'Die For You', 'I Feel It Coming', 'Reminder' became world famous. Then he was the most hyped singer back then. Then in 2018, he released 'My Dear Melancholy,' which also earned fame. At the end of 2019, he released the album 'After Hours' which was the most famous album by him. His album 'After Hours' was enough to make him the most famous artist on the planet. His song 'Blinding Lights' from the album became the most streamed song on Spotify. It's hard to believe that a random homeless guy can be the greatest singer on the planet. And also, he, all alone, released the songs 'Starboy', 'Blinding Lights', 'The Hills' etc.</p>
